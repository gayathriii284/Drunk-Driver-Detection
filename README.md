# Drunk-Driver-Detection
Detects the traffic on the road and catches drunk drivers that start randomly from different locations. This project uses python along with main open source libraries:
1.Folium (for plotting and visualizations on maps)
2.Geopy (to calculate distances between two points in a map etc.)

Two free APIs used are:
1.Openrouteservice API (for the points of interest (POI) service that helps finding coordinates of all places with liquor licenses like restaurants,bars,clubs etc)
2.Route and Directions (Rapid API) (for finding routes along with duration and distance between 10000 pairs of randomly selected pairs, provides free service for 30,000 requests/month)
